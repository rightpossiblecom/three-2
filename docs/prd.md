# 🥇 App Name

### 🏆 **Three.**


If you want something more brandable long term → **Rule of 3** is excellent.

For fastest Play Store approval → **3 Tasks Only** (very clear what it does).

---

# Simple App Plan (Non-Technical)

## App Goal

**Three.** is a minimal daily focus app that allows users to set **only three tasks per day**.

No lists.
No overwhelm.
No productivity systems.

Just three things that matter today.

At midnight, tasks reset.

---

## What The App Does

* User can add up to 3 tasks
* User can mark them complete
* User can delete a task
* Tasks automatically reset the next day

That’s it.

---

## What The App Does NOT Do

* No accounts
* No syncing
* No cloud
* No categories
* No reminders
* No data collection
* No productivity coaching claims

This keeps it extremely safe.

---

# Core User Story

> As a user, I open the app in the morning, add the three most important things I need to do today, complete them, and feel focused.

---

# App Pages (Minimal Structure)

## 1️⃣ Home Screen (Main & Only Real Screen)

This is 95% of the app.

Layout:

Top:

* Today’s date
* Small text: “You can only choose three.”

Middle:

* 3 task slots

  * Empty state: “Add your first task”
  * Checkbox to mark complete
  * Delete icon

Bottom:

* Input field
* Add button (disabled after 3 tasks)

When 3 tasks are added:

* Input disappears or becomes disabled
* Small message: “That’s enough for today.”

Simple. Clean.

---

## 2️⃣ Stats Page (Optional but Good for Approval)

Very simple:

* Days completed
* Current streak 🔥
* Total tasks completed

This makes the app feel more “complete” to reviewers.

---

## 3️⃣ Settings Page

Minimal:

* Toggle: Enable streak counter
* Toggle: Dark mode
* Reset all data
* App version
* Privacy Policy link

---

## Daily Reset Logic (User Experience Level)

At midnight:

* Tasks clear
* Completed tasks count toward streak
* New day starts fresh

If user completed all 3 yesterday:

* Streak +1
  If not:
* Streak resets

That’s your optional engagement mechanic 🔥

---

# MVP Scope (3-Hour Realistic Build)

### Must Have

* Add task (max 3)
* Mark complete
* Delete task
* Auto reset daily
* Local storage only

### Optional If Time Allows

* Streak counter
* Simple stats page
* Dark mode

---

# Why This Is Stronger Than Most Productivity Apps

* Removes decision fatigue
* Artificial constraint = focus
* No overwhelm
* Feels intentional
* Very clear identity

This could actually grow into something big later.

---

# Play Store Safety Positioning

Description should say:

* “Minimal daily focus app”
* “Choose three priorities”
* “Stay focused on what matters today”

Avoid:

* ADHD claims
* Mental health improvements
* “Scientifically proven”
* “Boost your brain”

Keep it productivity only.

---

# Why Google Will Approve This Easily

* No sensitive topics
* No user accounts
* No personal data
* No financial content
* Fully functional
* Clear purpose
* Not misleading

This is extremely low risk.

---

# Final Recommendation

If your goal is:

* Build fast
* Get approved fast
* Possibly scale later
