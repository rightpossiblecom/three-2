so we would start working on this project, firs the prd in in the docs

we would first rebrand the web app loacated as /landing page, do not touch the flutter app for now, you follow the  docs\LANDING_PAGE_REBRANDING_GUIDE.md and do everthing thing in there, everything, then you document your progress in docs\REBRANDING_PROGRESS.md

pls this app should loook doffrent fromt he current one, cuurent one is used for another priject, check the name color and theme, use a nice and better design system, for it, follow the rebrading guide and do evvething arcodingly, create new logo for it , use it in the page and also, use it for favicon also, so lets do this 



@prd.md#L1-207 yo bro this is our prd, we are not building the app yet we want to build the landing  page and website that will contain all the legal and nessary info
